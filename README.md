# ROUTER FLASHER 
**Automate your router firmware updates.**
This repository contains Python scripts designed to automate the flashing of SD-WAN routers. The script leverages Linux OS and SSH to connect to routers and perform firmware updates automatically. It simplifies the process by using a configuration file where users can specify router details, credentials, and firmware paths. This setup ensures that users can flash different devices without modifying the script directly, enhancing security and ease of use.
## Features
- Automated Firmware Flashing: Connects to routers via SSH and performs firmware flashing operations.
- Configuration File: Uses a text file to manage router IPs, credentials, and firmware paths.
- Ease of Use: Update router details in the configuration file without altering the script.
- Enhanced Security: Keeps sensitive information like credentials separate from the script.
